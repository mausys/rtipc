## RTIPC

**RTIPC** is a a zero-copy, wait-free inter-process communication (IPC) library optimized for real-time systems.

### Features
- **Zero-copy & syscall-free:** Extremely fast data transfer with no memory copying or system calls.
- **Deterministic behavior:** Data updates do not impact the runtime of the receiving process.
- **Real-time message handling:** Producers can send messages even when the queue is fullâ€”automatically discarding the oldest message to make room for the new one. This guarantees that the most recent data is always available.
- **SMP-optimized:** Messages are cacheline-aligned to minimize unnecessary cache coherence traffic in multi-core systems.
- **Event notification:** Optional *eventfd* support for integration with *select*, *poll*, and *epoll* event loops.
- **Multithreading:** Multiple threads can communicate concurrently over separate channels.

### Limitations
- **Fixed-size messages and queues:** Both the size of each message and the number of messages in a queue are fixed at creation time.

### Design
At its core, RTIPC uses a wait-free, zero-copy, single-producer single-consumer (SPSC) circular message queue. This queue allows a producer to overwrite the oldest message if the queue is full, ensuring real-time safety without blocking or performance degradation.

### How It Works

1. The client initializes a channel vector based on desired parameters.
2. This channel vector contains one or more producer/consumer channels, all mapped onto a shared memory region.
3. The client shares the memory region and configuration (including optional metadata) with the server via a Unix socket.
4. The server then constructs its own matching channel vector, enabling seamless inter-process communication.
